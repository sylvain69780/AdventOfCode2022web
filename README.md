# AdventOfCode2022web

This application aims to improve my practice of the C# language.

Yes it is possible to create a Web SPA application in C#, thanks to WebAssembly !

Here you will find my solutions to Advent of Code 2022 puzzles. This is an awesome event, and you are free to pay a tip (like I did) to Eric Wastl.

Day 27 is a Sudoku Solver, with no relation with Advent of Code !

Below [Advent of Code Legal notice](https://adventofcode.com/about), it allows me to publish here the code of my solutions.

I also use [ImageShap](https://sixlabors.com/pricing/) for some bitmap visualizations, free for personal non profit use.
